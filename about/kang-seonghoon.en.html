<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<dl>
	<dt>How to write your name?</dt>
	<dd>Only <em>Kang Seonghoon</em> is acceptable, since <em>Kang</em> is my family name; <em>Seonghoon Kang</em> can be seen from somewhere such as papers, but I don't like it. <em>KANG Seonghoon</em> is also acceptable though.</dd>
	<dt>How to pronounce your name?</dt>
	<dd>Approximately /kaŋ.sʌŋ.ɸun/ in <abbr title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</abbr>. I expect most non-Koreans are hard to pronounce this correctly, so I don't care. Note that first /k/ should pronounce an average of /'k/ (stressed /k/) and /g/.</dd>
	<dt>Have you stopped using <em>tokigun</em> really?</dt>
	<dd>Yes, but I still use it in some websites for legacy.</dd>
