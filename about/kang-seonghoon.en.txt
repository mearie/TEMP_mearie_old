Kang Seonghoon[^1] is a South Korean graduate student[^2] of [KAIST](http://kaist.edu/) majored in [computer science](http://cs.kaist.ac.kr/), and also a software developer have participated in (and sometimes started) several free & open source projects. My interest in CS ranges from programming languages to human-computer interaction and World Wide Web, and other interest includes music video games, Japanese comics and animations.

*lifthrasiir* and *arachneng* are my current nicknames in use. Albeit out of usage now, I have used other nickname, *tokigun*, for years, so you may assume that this nickname also refers to me.

See my official <del>[curriculum vitae](curriculum-vitae)</del> (not available currently), or [contact](contact) page for how to get in contact with me.

[^1]: This is a Korean name (spelled <span lang="ko">강 성훈</span>), where the last name comes first and the first name follows it. I don't prefer any other form or transliteration, other than *Seonghoon Kang* occasionally found in research papers.
