<p><strong>PyFunge</strong> is an implementation of Befunge-93/Funge-98 interpreter in Python. Its goal is fully functional, compliant and optimizing implementation of Funge-98. Strikingly, such implementation is rare, according to <a href="http://iki.fi/matti.niemenmaa/befunge/mycology-comparison.html">Mycology test suite</a>.</p>
<p>This project was started in 2004 at <a href="http://kldp.net/projects/pyfunge/">KLDP</a>, forgotten for five years, and finally revived in 2009.</p>

<h2>Development</h2>
<p>See <a href="http://hg.mearie.org/pyfunge/">Mercurial repository</a> for now. I'm targeting next major release, 0.5, to the following features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Mostly (if not fully) comforming to Funge-98 specification.</li>
	<li>Complete abstraction of Funge environment, easily pluggable API</li>
	<li>Implementation of common fingerprints.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also interested in the following subjects, though they will take much longer:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Integrated development environment for Funge-98. It will require 3D graphics, instruction flow visualization etc.</li>
	<li>More fingerprints like Python binding.</li>
	<li>Optimization and static compilation of Funge-98 program. This is a huge challenge, but nevertheless there is on-going JIT compilation attempt.</li>
</ul>
