**PyFunge** is an implementation of Befunge-93/Funge-98 interpreter in Python. Its goal is fully functional, compliant and optimizing implementation of Funge-98. Strikingly, such implementation is rare, according to [Mycology test suite](http://iki.fi/matti.niemenmaa/befunge/mycology-comparison.html).

This project was started in 2004 at [KLDP](http://kldp.net/projects/pyfunge/), forgotten for five years, and finally revived in 2009. PyFunge is a free software, distributed in terms of permissive MIT/X11 license.
