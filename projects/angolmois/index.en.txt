**_Angolmois_** is a BM98-like rhythm game which supports the so-called [BMS format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be-Music_Script) for playing.

Originally conceived as an extremely minimal rhythm game that will only be appropriate for [strange codes](/projects/strange) section, it has a unique distinction of being only BMS player natively supporting multiple platforms and recent BMS extensions. The name, *Angolmois*, was an homage to [Project Angolmois](http://angolmois.net/), as the final source code was to be shaped as like one of characters of it.[^1] Therefore it is somewhat different from other popular BMS players.

[^1]: The goal was never reached, and only remaining influences are the icon above and copyright notice in the source code. Still, I deeply thank to everyone who took an interest in this project, including Choi Kaya, the very author of Project Angolmois.



Features
========

* Single executable. Every required assets including *fonts* are generated from the source code. (As a result non-ASCII characters will be broken, but this does not affect the game play.)
* Supports almost every platform. I have tested at least three platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X) and [SDL](http://libsdl.org/) supports some more.
* No song select interface, everything except the game play is done from the command line.
* Supports many recent BMS extensions, which are definitely a state of the art for non-Windows BMS players.
	* Seven-key (BME) and nine-key (PMS) support
	* Custom channel mapping for simulating other BMS extensions
	* Long notes (`#LNTYPE 1`, `#LNTYPE 2`, `#LNOBJ`)
	* Bombs (channels `Dx`/`Ex`)
	* Variable BPMs
	* Recent random BMS extensions (`#SETRANDOM` etc.)
	* Image file format other than BMP (as long as [SDL_image](http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) supports it)
	* Sound file format other than WAV (as long as [SDL_mixer](http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/) supports it)
	* Multiple movie playback (as long as [smpeg](http://icculus.org/smpeg/) supports it)
* Supports the basic game play and nothing else.
	* Playback speed from 0.1x to 99x
	* Multiple key reassignments (you can also map the joystick controller to keys)
	* Grading and score rules that suck
	* Gauge and clear rules that suck
	* Mirror and random options
	* Automatic play
	* Headless automatic play ("exclusive mode") &mdash; You can use Angolmois as a music player for BMS files with this option and scripting.
* Only ~2000 lines of C codes.
* Free and open source software.
