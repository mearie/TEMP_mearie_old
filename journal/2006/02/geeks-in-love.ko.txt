[Albino Black Sheep - Geeks in Love](http://albinoblacksheep.com/flash/geeks)

오랜만에 정말 마음에 드는 노래(와 함께 뮤직 비디오)다. 원곡은 Lemon Demon의 [Geeks in Love](http://www.eviltrailmix.com/lemondemon/skippy.html). 발렌타인 데이 기념-_-이라던가.

다음은 가사.

> Nobody's cool as we, nor quite as esoterically far out.  
> We're so far out it's creepy.  
> I don't think they'll ever get the groovy standards that we set for love,  
> but they're not smart like we be.
> 
> They have no roses.  
> Subconsciously they envy us a lot.  
> They look down their noses and see a couple of dorks with more love than they have got.
> 
> When they see us holding hands, they wish that they were geeks in love.  
> And when they hear our favorite bands, they wish that they were geeks in love.  
> We rattle off our in-jokes while they wish that they were geeks in love.  
> And while we make each other smile, they wish that they were geeks in...

> As far as I can tell, while other lovers go through hell,  
> we'll know we're too cool for damnation.  
> We may not be cutting edge, but we won't take the mainstream pledge,  
> for we don't need your admiration.
> 
> They may not show it.  
> It doesn't fit their made-up little roles.  
> They don't even know it, but jealousy abounds within their souls.
> 
> When they see us on the street, they wish that they were geeks in love.  
> And when they hear us trick or treat, they wish that they were geeks in love.  
> As we lock arms and skip away, they wish that they were geeks in love.  
> And you can almost hear them say they wish that they were geeks in...
